## Authentication procedure

1. __Identification__ of the user (who is it?)
2. __Provision__ of some kind of authentication information, which is secret and unforgeable.
3. __Transmission__ of the authentication information to the system through a secure channel.
4. __Validation__ of the authentication information with some reference information (proof of correctness).

The authentication information can be of __3 different, generic types__, based on something that is unique for the user:

* Something you __KNOW__ (e.g password, PIN code)
* Something you __HAVE__ (e.g smartcard)
* Something you __ARE (DO)__ (e.g fingerprint), (biometrical methods, something characteristic about you)
* (__WHERE__ you are can also be used in some situations)

In general, something that you have is called a _token_. i.e. something that is used for authentication.

A __capability__ is an unforgeable token that gives the possessor certain _rights_ (to an object) - __authorization__

## Ethics

#### Consequence-based theory
The __teleological theory__ of ethics focuses on the _consequences of actions_. Choose the action (among some set) that will result in the __greatest good and the least harm__.

There are two forms of teleology
* Egoism – relates to the person taking the action
* Utilitarianism – relates to everybody, the whole "universe"

#### Rule-based theory
The __deontology theory__ is founded in a _sense of duty_. Certain things are inherently good, i.e. good (or bad) in
themselves, e.g. truth, justice, freedom, peace, etc.

There is a special form of deontology, __rule-deontology__ that believes that there are a set of __universal, self-evident rules__ that should specify our proper conduct

## Kerberos

**T**ime **O**f **C**heck to **T**ime **O**f **U**se

Class of software bug caused by changes in a system between the __checking__ of a condition (such as a security credential) and the __use__ of the results of that check. This is one example of a __race condition__.
